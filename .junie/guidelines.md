# Project Guidelines

## Project Overview
This repository is an Nx-based monorepo intended to host multiple frontend applications across different frameworks (Angular, React, Vue, Qwik, etc.). Nx provides a consistent developer experience for building, testing, linting, and serving apps using a single toolchain.

Key technologies and tools configured in this workspace:
- Nx 21 for monorepo orchestration
- Vite for dev/build where applicable (React/Vue/Svelte/etc.)
- Angular build tools for Angular apps
- Vitest and/or Jest for unit tests (workspace includes both capabilities)
- Playwright for e2e tests (via Nx plugin)
- ESLint 9 for linting; Prettier for formatting
- TypeScript 5.8

Relevant top-level directories and files:
- apps/ — individual applications live here (e.g., Angular, React, Qwik, etc.)
- libs/ — reusable libraries (create as needed; may be empty initially)
- .junie/guidelines.md — this file, with project conventions for Junie
- nx.json, package.json, tsconfig.base.json — workspace configuration
- eslint.config.mjs — lint configuration
- README.md — general Nx usage info generated by Nx

CI and caching:
- Nx Cloud is configured (nxCloudId present in nx.json) to speed up CI with remote caching if connected.

## How to Work in This Repo
- List projects: npx nx show projects
- Visualize project graph and dependencies: npx nx graph

### Run a Dev Server
- npx nx serve <project-name>
  - Example: npx nx serve angular-project

### Build
- npx nx build <project-name>

### Unit Tests
- npx nx test <project-name>
  - Most projects use Vitest via @nx/vite; some may use Jest depending on the plugin. The target is abstracted behind nx test.

### E2E Tests
- npx nx e2e <e2e-project-name>
  - Playwright is configured as the default e2e runner for Angular apps via Nx.

### Linting and Type Checking
- Lint: npx nx lint <project-name>
- Typecheck (when available): npx nx typecheck <project-name>

### Formatting
- Use Prettier. Standard settings are implied by eslint.config.mjs and Prettier defaults in the workspace.

## Junie-specific Instructions
When making changes, Junie should:
1. Prefer minimal changes that satisfy the issue requirements.
2. If code was modified (beyond docs), run locally for the affected project(s):
   - npx nx lint <project>
   - npx nx test <project>
   - npx nx build <project>
3. If uncertain which projects are affected, consult: npx nx graph and npx nx show projects
4. Avoid creating files outside the repo root. Use Windows-style paths when needed.
5. If adding frameworks/apps, use Nx generators where possible.

## Node/Tooling Assumptions
- Node.js 20.x recommended
- pnpm/npm/yarn are supported by Nx; this workspace currently uses npm (lockfile present). Use npx to run Nx commands without global installs.

## Conventions
- Keep code style consistent with ESLint and Prettier.
- Follow framework-specific best practices (Angular, React, Vue, Qwik) as generated by Nx plugins.
- Favor small, focused PRs/commits.
